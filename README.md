# CSI 4142 - Assignment 2: Data Cleaning 

This project was completed as part of the **Fundamentals of Data Science (CSI 4142)** course at the University of Ottawa.  
It focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** of a **Credit Score Classification dataset**.

---

## Dataset
**Credit Score Classification Dataset**  
- Attributes: annual income, payment behavior, credit history, loan details, credit utilization ratio, etc.  
- Source: provided as part of CSI 4142 coursework.  

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Google Colab** (Jupyter Notebook environment)  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## Workflow
1. Importation of the dataset (CSV, zipped format).  
2. Initial exploration: size, structure, column overview.  
3. Data cleaning:  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Fixing inconsistent values (e.g., categorical cleaning)  
   - Type conversions  
4. Preprocessing for future **machine learning models**.  

---

## Key Insights
- Missing values in income and loan columns were addressed.  
- Payment behavior and credit utilization proved critical for predicting credit scores.  
- Dataset cleaned and ready for **predictive modeling**.
